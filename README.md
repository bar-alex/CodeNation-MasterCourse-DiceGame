# CodeNation-MasterCourse-DiceGame
A dice game project (1 and 2 players) for the master course week 3

The project is live at https://candid-squirrel-2c6af4.netlify.app/

I've tried out a bunch of stuff so I could learn them, CSS mainly but Javascript DOM manipulation too, 
probably ended up over-complicating the thing ðŸ˜…

Here's some of the stuff I got working in this project: 

* Frosty glass effect
* Can switch between one and two player mode
* Greeting / Winning / Losing screens
* Sounds for dice roll, winning, losing screens, turn the sound on / off
* Score text with color filler effect on the text itself
* Dice with sprite animation and some cubic-bezier based rotation thrown in to create a .. dice roll simulation

+ Used JavaScript to bind on click/dbl-click, show/hide dom elements, enable/disable buttons, change styles, add/remove animations, play sounds, 
and the actual game logic.
